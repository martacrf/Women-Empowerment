    "### 1.3. Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite progress towards gender equality, women often face stereotypes that directly or indirectly limit their roles to homestaying related jobs, all over the world, even in developed countries. \n",
    "This can contribute to discourage women from entering the workforce, especially in high-tech fields, and pursuing STEM education, contributing for a bigger gender gap.\n",
    "As a woman in this society and as a woman in tech, I witness firsthand how male dominance and society steryotypes can negatively influence us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing these biases is crucial for empowering women all over the world.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- As a woman in tech, I want to understand my chances of succeeding in a top role, recognize my value, and understand how impactful we can be in leadership positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a business leader, I want to understand how gender diversity contributes to and impacts a country performance. When understanding this impact, I aim to promote and create more opportunities for women to join important decision-making positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a member of the general public, I want to understand the socio-economic implications of women's representation in leadership and the impacts per country on women with STEM education. I aim to combat stereotypes about the role of women in society and advocate for a more inclusive future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses data from The World Bank Group's Gender Statistics database (2004-2023) to explore these issues. It aims to empower women by highlighting their potential in leadership roles and by persuing STEM education, demonstrating the impact of gender diversity on organizational success, and advocating for societal change towards greater gender equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4. Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this EDA we are going to focus on the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 - Which countries have the highest and lowest representation of women in top positions?\n",
    "- 2 - How does this compare with the overall percentage of women in the workforce and in STEM?\n",
    "- 3 - Is there a correlation between GDP and the percentage of women in top positions?\n",
    "- 4 - Are countries with higher education levels for women (especially in STEM) showing better gender diversity in leadership?\n",
    "\n",
